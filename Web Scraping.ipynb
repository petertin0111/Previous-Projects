INTRODUCTION\\r\\n\\r\\n     This opinion and order relates to Grant Thornton\\'s audits of\\r\\nChambers\\' financial statements for the years ended December 31,\\r\\n1989, and 1990.  In both years, Grant Thornton issued audit\\r\\nreports containing unqualified opinions and statements that the\\r\\ncompany\\'s financial statements were fairly presented in\\r\\nconformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\")\\r\\nand that the audits were conducted in accordance with generally\\r\\naccepted auditing standards (\"GAAS\").  \\r\\n\\r\\n     In fact, as explained below, the company\\'s financial\\r\\nstatements were not presented in conformity with GAAP, and the\\r\\nauditors failed to conduct the 1989 and 1990 audits in accordance\\r\\nwith GAAS.  Restated financial statements filed with the\\r\\nCommission on December 30, 1992, reduced Chambers\\' net earnings\\r\\nreported for 1989 and 1990 from a total of $61.5 million to a\\r\\ntotal net loss of $57.1 million.  \\r\\n\\r\\n     During 1989 and 1990, Chambers understated its expenses and\\r\\noverstated its earnings by engaging in certain fraudulent\\r\\ncapitalization practices.  Chambers calculated expenses and\\r\\ncapitalized costs based on profit margins management determined\\r\\nin advance.  In preparing its financial statements during this\\r\\nperiod, Chambers calculated its expenses based on percentages of\\r\\nrevenue and capitalized or deferred the remainder of its costs. \\r\\nCompany personnel did not prepare documentation showing\\r\\nallocations of these amounts out of expense accounts and into\\r\\nasset accounts until after Chambers publicly announced its\\r\\nearnings for the period.-[4]-  \\r\\n\\r\\n---------FOOTNOTES----------\\r\\n     -[4]-     The Commission filed  a separate, civil injunctive\\r\\naction  against Chambers.   See SEC v.  Chambers Development Co.,\\r\\nInc., Lit.  Rel. No. 14496  (W.D.

No. 764 (February 27, 1996).\\r\\n\\r\\n     -[5]-     In years  prior to 1990,  Goldberger\\'s predecessor\\r\\nas the audit partner on the Chambers audits reviewed and approved\\r\\nthe  audit  programs and  workpapers.    After  the  1989  audit,\\r\\nGoldberger\\'s  predecessor became  the chief financial  officer of\\r\\nChambers.\\x0c\\r\\n==========================================START OF PAGE 5======\\r\\n\\r\\n     In 1990, Goldberger and French primarily relied on\\r\\nanalytical procedures to test the $97 million Chambers had\\r\\ncapitalized as landfill site and acquisition and development\\r\\ncosts.  French had prepared an audit program setting forth these\\r\\nprocedures for the 1987 audit and Grant Thornton had applied them\\r\\nsince then without material changes.  In 1990, as in the past,\\r\\nthese procedures included comparisons by expense category of\\r\\namounts capitalized to amounts incurred for the year ended\\r\\nDecember 31, 1990, and for the preceding five-year period.  The\\r\\naudit procedures also included inquiries of Chambers\\' controller\\r\\nand other personnel to relate development activities to amounts\\r\\ncapitalized.  \\r\\n\\r\\n     French interviewed individuals about the factors considered\\r\\nwhen the amounts capitalized were derived, and he believed\\r\\nChambers based the amounts capitalized on inquiry and observation\\r\\nof landfill development activities.  But French neither\\r\\ndocumented such findings in the workpapers, nor examined\\r\\ndocumentation to support the estimates.  He did not know whether\\r\\nChambers prepared documentation for the assumptions used to\\r\\ndetermine the estimates.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The auditors\\' workpapers reflect certain inquiries and other\\r\\nprocedures concerning increases in the amounts of capitalized\\r\\nlabor, professional services and miscellaneous expenses over\\r\\nthose capitalized in the previous year.  For example, capitalized\\r\\nlabor increased from $22.6 million in 1989 to $40 million in\\r\\n1990.  Goldberger and French did not corroborate with other\\r\\nevidential matter management\\'s responses to inquiries concerning\\r\\nthis material increase in labor costs.  French knew in the course\\r\\nof the 1990 audit that Chambers had not maintained labor records\\r\\nfor development costs.

The company\\'s restated\\r\\nfinancial statements reflect expenses of $8.3 million for\\r\\ninterest improperly capitalized in its original 1990 financial\\r\\nstatements and $9.2 million for interest improperly capitalized\\r\\nin its original 1989 financial statements.  The restatement of\\r\\ncapitalized interest resulted from material decreases in assets\\r\\nqualifying for interest capitalization.  The decreases in\\r\\nqualifying assets resulted from the reversal of: 1) unsupported\\r\\ncapitalized costs recorded in prior years; and 2) non-qualifying\\r\\ncosts of infrastructure related to already operating landfills.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34\\r\\nestablishes GAAP for interest capitalization.-[13]-  It\\r\\nprovides that assets qualifying for interest capitalization\\r\\ninclude \"assets that are constructed . . . for an enterprise\\'s\\r\\nown use . . . .\"  SFAS No. 34,   9.

      "1\n",
      "A. THE RESPONDENT\n",
      "Duff, a registered investment adviser since 1979, has its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois.  As of December 28, 2000, Duff managed 112 discretionary accounts with total assets of $9.5 billion.  Duff also was during the relevant period and continues to be an investment adviser to investment companies registered with the Commission under the Company Act.  In 1995, Duff's parent, Duff & Phelps Corporation, merged with Phoenix Securities Group, Inc., then a subsidiary of Hartford, Connecticut-based Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company.  Duff currently is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Phoenix Investment Management Company.  Phoenix Investment Management Company, in turn, is wholly owned by Phoenix Companies, Inc.\n",
      "B. FACTS\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "This proceeding is based on Duff's undisclosed direction of a total of $715,750 of advisory client commission business to East West Institutional Services, Inc. (\"East West), a Michigan broker-dealer, and a Chicago-based pension consultant (the \"Pension Consultant\"), in exchange for the referral of a client, a pension fund for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Union Local 710 (\"Local 710\").  Duff did not disclose to its clients its direction of brokerage in exchange for a client referral, and it affirmatively and falsely stated in its Commission filings that it did not direct commissions in exchange for client referrals.  Certain of the commissions that Duff directed for the benefit of East West to obtain the client referral involved transactions for an investment company with which Duff had an investment advisory agreement.\n",
      "In mid-1994, Duff, through a salesperson who was also a vice president of sales and marketing (\"Duff salesman\"), agreed to direct brokerage trades to East West.  In exchange, East West agreed toinfluence the Local 710 to award management of a portion of its pension fund to Duff.  East West was able to influence the Local 710 because it had an arrangement with two trustees of the Local 710 (\"the two trustees\"), who received illegal kickbacks of commissions from East West.  In June 1995, after Duff had directed $177,000 in commissions for the benefit of East West, East West influenced the Local 710 to select Duff to manage $120 million of its assets.  Senior officers of Duff knew or were reckless in not knowing about the directed brokerage scheme.\n",
      "2\n",
      "In or about the end of March 1996, Duff began to significantly reduce the amount of brokerage it directed to East West.  Instead, during this same time period, Duff entered into a soft-dollar agreement with the Pension Consultant, which at that time was advising the Local 710.\n",
      "3\n",
      "Duff agreed to pay a $100,000 annual fee with soft dollars to the Pension Consultant, derived from commission business directed to the Pension Consultant's broker-dealer affiliate, in exchange for a recommendation from the Pension Consultant that the Local 710 retain Duff as an investment adviser.  Pursuant to its arrangements, Duff continued to direct transactions to benefit East West until the spring of 1997 and to the Pension Consultant until July 1997. After Duff ceased directing commissions to those firms, the Local 710 terminated its contract with Duff. Duff did not disclose these arrangements to disinterested representatives of the Local 710 or its other clients while it retained management of the Local 710 account from June 1995 through July 1997.  As a result of the above, Duff willfully violated Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2) and 207 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-1(b)(1) thereunder as then in effect, and Section 17(e)(1) of the Company Act.\n",

      "(a)\n",
      "East West's Agreement with Local 710 and Duff's Agreement with East West\n",
      "In approximately 1994, East West entered into an arrangement with the two trustees of the Local 710.  Under this arrangement, East West agreed to kick back to the two trustees a portion of the commissions directed to it by the Local 710's investment advisers.  The advisers would direct the trades to East West through one of its clearing brokers, and East West would forward some of that money to the two trustees.\n",
      "In mid-1994, the Duff salesman met with a representative from East West.  The Duff salesman had learned that East West had the ability to influence selection or retention of money managers by the Local 710 pension fund.  East West and the Duff salesman agreed that Duff would direct $600,000 in commissions annually to benefit East West, and, in return, East West would influence the Local 710 to award management of $120 million of its pension fund to Duff.  East West specifically informed the Duff salesman that the directed brokerage arrangement should be concealed from the disinterested Local 710 trustees.  The two trustees of the Local 710 required Duff to direct a certain amount of business to East West before they awarded Duff management of the Local 710's assets.\n",
      "After meeting with East West, the Duff salesman told others at Duff, including senior officers, that if Duff directed commissions to East West, that firm could arrange for Duff to make a marketing pitch to the Local 710.  The Duff salesman further explained that Duff's chances of pitching the Local 710 as a client were directly related to the amount of commissions that Duff sent to East West.\n",
      "(b)\n",
      "Duff's Policies Regarding Brokerage Allocation\n",
      "In mid-1994, Duff's policies, as stated in its Form ADV, provided that the firm would not direct brokerage for the purpose of obtaining business referrals.  However, Duff allowed its marketing staff, such as the Duff salesman, to influence the direction of brokerage to firms that could potentially refer clients to Duff.\n",
      "(c)\n",
      "Duff Began Directing Brokerage for the Benefit of East West\n",
      "In mid-1994, Duff began directing commissions to benefit East West.  Senior officers of Duff knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Duff's direction of brokerage to East West was part of a\n",
      "quid pro quo\n",
      "to obtain the Local 710 as a client.  Beginning in late 1994, East West contacted the Duff salesman approximately once a week to demand additional commissions.  The Duff salesman, in turn, pressured other Duff employees to direct commissions.  Senior Duff officers were aware of and/or participated in attempts to pressure Duff's traders to direct commissions to East West, and they were further aware of the impropriety of such practices.  In January 1995, Duff's compliance officer notified the Duff salesman, Duff's president, and others at Duff that it was against Duff's policy, as stated in its Form ADV filed with the Commission, to direct brokerage to obtain client referrals.\n",
      "In an apparent attempt to legitimize Duff's direction of trades, East West sent Duff research that it received from its clearing brokers.  However, East West never attempted to evaluate whether the research was relevant to Duff's business.  In fact, East West was unfamiliar with Duff's investment strategy.  As a result, the research it sent to Duff generally was outdated and related minimally, if at all, to investment areas relevant to Duff's advisory service.\n",
      "(d)\n",
      "Duff Obtained the Local 710 Account\n",
      "In May 1995, approximately ten months after the Duff salesman entered into an agreement with East West, Duff officers, including the Duff salesman and Duff's president, made a presentation to theLocal 710's investment committee.  Prior to the presentation, East West told the two trustees of Local 710 that Duff would continue to direct commissions to East West.\n",
      "In June 1995, the Local 710 trustees selected Duff to manage a portion of its pension fund. Within weeks, the fund allocated $75 million to the account, and soon thereafter, in accordance with East West's representations to the Duff salesman, the Local 710 increased the amount to $120 million. During the two years that Duff managed the Local 710 pension fund, the fund paid Duff $985,870.46 in management fees.  Prior to obtaining the account, Duff directed approximately $177,000 in commissions from its other clients, including an investment company, for the benefit of East West. Between June 1995 and the spring of 1997, Duff directed approximately $435,000 in equity commissions for the benefit of East West, for a total of $613,000 in commissions directed for the benefit of East West from mid-1994 to the spring of 1997.\n",
      "On February 14, 1996, the Duff salesman, Duff's president, Duff's compliance officer, Duff's chairman, and Duff's head of fixed income met to discuss brokerage allocation.  The Duff salesman informed the group that Duff would lose the Local 710 account unless it directed $600,000 in commissions over the next six months to East West.  Duff's head of fixed income objected to the practice of directing brokerage in exchange for client referrals.  Duff's compliance officer stated that Duff should not set a specific dollar amount of commissions for any broker, and Duff's chairman agreed.  Nevertheless, Duff continued to direct commissions to East West, including approximately $124,000 in commissions from the time of the February 14, 1996 meeting until Duff ceased direction of brokerage to East West in the spring of 1997.  Commissions directed for the benefit of East West declined during this time period only after Duff reached a soft dollar arrangement with the Pension Consultant, as described below.\n",
      "In September 1996, in order to send a message to Duff that it needed to pay more commissions, East West and the two trustees caused Local 710 to reduce the amount of its account under Duff's management by $50 million.  The reduction of assets was instigated by the two trustees and East West, who wanted to show Duff that it was in danger of losing the account.\n",
      "In January 1997, Duff reaffirmed to the disinterested Local 710 trustees the accuracy of Duff's representations, warrants and covenants in its contract with the Local 710, which related to, among other things, the accuracy of Duff's Form ADV.  As explained in more detail below, Duff's amendments to Forms ADV filed with the Commission between March 1995 and March 1997 contained material misrepresentations and omissions.  In March 1997, the Duff salesman left Duff to take a position with another investment adviser.  In April 1997, Duff's president left Duff to join with others in forming an investment management firm.  Although payments to East West ceased in the spring of 1997, Duff retained management of the Local 710 account through July 1997, and continued receiving management fees through that time, without ever disclosing to the disinterested representatives of Local 710 that it had obtained management of the account by directing brokerage to East West.\n",
      "(e)\n",
      "Direction of Commissions from Investment Companies\n",
      "From at least November 1995, Duff had investment advisory agreements with certain investment companies.  Duff directed trades on behalf of at least one of those investment companies for the benefit of East West as part of the scheme to obtain the Local 710 account.  During the relevant time period, at least one of the investment companies paid commissions of at least $284,975.85 to East West's clearing broker for trades directed in furtherance of Duff's scheme.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Duff Paid the Pension Consultant to Retain the Pension Fund Account but Lost the Account After Ceasing Payments to East West and the Pension Consultant\n",
      "In late 1994 or early 1995, the Local 710 hired the Pension Consultant, ostensibly to provide recommendations concerning its selection of money managers.  In March 1995, the Pension Consultant recommended that the Local 710 hire Duff, which at the time was directing brokerage for the benefit of East West.  As explained above, Duff obtained management of a portion of the Local 710 pension fund shortly thereafter.\n",
      "In March 1996, after learning at the February 14, 1996 brokerage allocation meeting referenced above that Duff could not guarantee the direction of a specific dollar amount of commissions to East West and concluding that Duff would not be able to meet East West's demands for more commissions, the Duff salesman negotiated a soft dollar agreement with the Pension Consultant.  Under this agreement, Duff agreed to pay a $100,000 annual fee with soft dollars to the Pension Consultant by directing commission business to the Pension Consultant's broker-dealer affiliate in exchange for a recommendation from the Pension Consultant that the Local 710 retain Duff as an investment adviser. Pursuant to this agreement, Duff began paying soft dollars to the Pension Consultant in July 1996. Thereafter,  the Pension Consultant continued to recommend that the Local 710 retain Duff as an adviser.\n",
      "In an effort to create the appearance that the $100,000 in directed commissions were for a legitimate purpose rather than to buy a recommendation, the Pension Consultant provided research to Duff comparing Duff's products and services with those of its peers.  The research was substantially similar to research that Duff had purchased from another firm for an annual fee of no more than $40,000.\n",
      "As stated above, Duff ceased directing brokerage to East West in the spring of 1997.  Duff canceled its contract with the Pension Consultant on June 30, 1997.  Two weeks later, the Local 710 notified Duff that it was being terminated as an investment adviser to Local 710.  From July 1996 until the cancellation of its contract with the Pension Consultant, Duff paid a total of $102,750 in soft dollars to the Pension Consultant.  Duff failed to disclose to its clients during this time period that it was directing commissions to the Pension Consultant in exchange for a favorable recommendation.\n",

      "Duff's Amendments to Form ADV Filed with the Commission Contained Material False Statements and Omissions\n",
      "Part II of Duff's amended Form ADV filed with the Commission and distributed to its clients did not disclose that Duff received client referrals in exchange for brokerage commission allocation. Indeed, in some instances, Duff affirmatively represented that it did not engage in such practices.  On March 28, 1994, Duff filed an amendment to Form ADV with the Commission, which was signed by Duff's president.  Duff answered \"yes\" to Part II, Item 12.A(3), which asks whether the applicant or any related person has authority to determine, without obtaining specific client consent, the broker or dealer to be used.  A \"yes\" answer to this question requires that the applicant describe on Schedule F the factors considered in selecting brokers and determining the reasonableness of their commissions.  If the value of products, research and services given to the applicant or a related person is a factor, the applicant must describe, among other things: (1) the products, research and services; and (2) any procedure the applicant used during the last fiscal year to direct client transactions to a particular broker in return for products and research services received.  Under Item 12 on Schedule F of Duff's March 1994 Form ADV, Duff stated, among other things:\n",
      "Under no circumstances do we share in commissions paid by our clients to brokerage firms\n",
      "nor do we receive referrals of potential investment counsel clients from brokerage firms in return for allocating brokerage business to them.\n",
      "(emphasis added).\n",
      "In addition, on its March 1994 amendment to Form ADV, Duff answered \"yes\" to Item 13.A of Part II, which asks whether the applicant or a related person has any arrangements, oral or in writing, where it is paid cash by or receives some economic benefit (including commissions, equipment or non-research services) from a non-client in connection with giving advice to clients.  In its description on Schedule F, Duff described its participation in certain wrap fee programs with brokers, but not any arrangements to receive client referrals in exchange for brokerage.  Furthermore, Duff answered \"no\" to Item 13.B. of Part II of Form ADV, which asks whether the applicant or a related person has any arrangements, oral or in writing, where it directly or indirectly compensates any person for client referrals.\n",
      "Duff's answers to Items 12 and 13 of Part II of Form ADV remained essentially the same on the amendments to Form ADV signed by Duff's president and filed on March 31, 1995 and December 22, 1995, and on the amendments to Form ADV signed by Duff's compliance officer, and filed on January 5, 1996, and March 29, 1996.  On December 13, 1996, Duff filed an amendment to Form ADV, also signed by the compliance officer, on which it answered \"yes\" to Item 13.B., indicating that it had arrangements to directly or indirectly compensate persons for client referrals.  However, its description on Schedule F again explained Duff's participation in certain wrap fee programs with brokers, without mentioning any arrangements to receive client referrals in exchange for brokerage, and also contained the same affirmative statement that Duff does not, under any circumstances, receivereferrals of potential investment counsel clients from brokerage firms in return for allocating brokerage business.  Duff's amendment to Form ADV filed on March 26, 1997, again signed by the compliance officer, was identical to the previous amendment, except that it deleted the statement that Duff did not receive referrals in exchange for allocation of brokerage commissions.  Despite the removal of this affirmative representation, Duff nevertheless failed to disclose the direction of commissions to East West and the Pension Consultant in exchange for the referral of a client.\n",
